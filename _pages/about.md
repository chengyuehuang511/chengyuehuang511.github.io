I am an undergraduate student in [School of Statistics, Renmin University of China](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/Home/index.htm). I am a "SLASH" person, a statistics major interested in artificial intelligence, a science student passionate about music. My research interests include:
- Deep learning and representation learning from mathematical and statistical principles (e.g. XAI, statistical machine learning);
- Applying statistical and machine learning methods to biology (e.g. knowledge graph, genomics, epidemic);
- Intersection of music and science, promoting musical development via AI (e.g. music composition).

I am currently seeking for Ph.D. positions in these interdisciplinary fields. You are more than welcome to contact me if you want to know more about me or collaborate with me.
