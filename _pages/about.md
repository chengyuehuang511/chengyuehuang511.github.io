I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Robotics Perception and Learning Lab (RIPL) at Georgia Institute of Technology advised by Prof. [Zsolt Kira](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~zk15/). Previously, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Hongteng Xu](https://hongtengxu.github.io/) in Structured Data Science Lab (SDSL) at Renmin University of China. My research interests are in the areas of machine learning and computer vision. I currently work on enhancing the adaptability and generalization capabilities of foundation models.
